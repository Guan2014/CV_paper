### low light, single photon camera.  (not in my field)

### object attributes and relations

GCN + object location + mask -> segmentation layout + appearance vectors -> Resmodule -> Image, GAN loss

(Mask feature matching loss, image feature matching loss, perceptual loss)

Can use object name and its position to generate images, and tune the hidden vector, the image will change.

### point-line minimal problems in complete multi-view visibility 

obtain 39 candidates by counting dimensions

remove that has little solutions, leave 30.

3d/2d dimension, how to calculate, how to use.

each minimal problem gives a system of polynomial equations, and solve a generic example and count of its solutions.

solve time (faster?, may future work)

### Singan: learning a generative model using a single image (Best!)

scale 1/8 or 1/16, mask part of image and generate, and upsample, and mask and generate... (multi-scale generator)

can change the dimension of the input, the output will change, preserve the texture.

can change the input image, do the same thing like cycleGan

can change the input style, cartoon or painting or skeleton.

can change the input image by mask (or add a small png in it), something like poison image editing.

Harmonisation, can change the local part of the add mask/png.

can use for super-resolution, becuz its multi-scale training. Gn -> Gn-1 -> G0 -> G0 (add a G0), cool!

Random walk in latent space can generate gif. (animation), can also change the intensity.

Code available.
